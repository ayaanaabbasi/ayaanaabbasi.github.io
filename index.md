# Mohammad Ayaan Abbasi  
### Data Science · AI · Analytics  
Building real-world data products with clarity, structure, and impact.

I turn complex datasets into clear insights and deployable solutions — whether it’s
VC investment analysis, LLM-based recommendation systems, or interactive dashboards
that explain trends without noise.

My work blends **data engineering, modeling, and product thinking**, with a focus on:

- End-to-end analytics projects  
- LLM development (Prompting → Fine-Tuning → RAG)  
- Interactive dashboards with business-level storytelling  
- Clean architecture, reproducible pipelines, and thoughtful UI choices  

If you want to see how I think, build, and communicate — start with the projects below.
