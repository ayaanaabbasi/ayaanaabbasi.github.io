🚀 Startup VC Funding Dashboard

Interactive data product analyzing 100k+ global VC funding rounds using Python & Streamlit.

🔍 Problem

Understanding where venture capital is flowing — geographically, by industry, and over time — requires transforming raw funding records into a clear, interactive data product.

🎯 Approach

Cleaned and explored 100k+ funding transactions

Created high-signal visuals for trends, geographies, and industry patterns

Built a dark-mode Streamlit dashboard with filters for:
Year range • Industry • Country • Color theme

Computed metrics such as:
Total VC raised, total rounds, top industries, top countries

📈 Key Insights

The U.S. consistently dominates global VC flow

Software + biotech receive the highest capital concentration

Funding activity surges significantly post-2010

Several mega-round outliers heavily skew total dollars

🖥️ Deliverables

🧠 What I Learned

Designing dashboards that reveal real business insights

Managing large datasets and eliminating bias from outliers

Balancing aesthetics with core usability principles in Streamlit

Structuring data products that show both technical and strategic thinking

## 2) Travel Recommendation System (LLM-Based)

**Summary:**  
Modular system comparing three approaches to generating travel recommendations using LLMs: prompting, fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation (in progress).

**Approach:**  
- Structured evaluation of prompt-based models  
- Fine-tuned a T5 model on curated travel data  
- Began building RAG embedding/indexing pipeline  

**Key Results:**  
- Prompting struggled with consistency  
- Fine-tuned model showed improved relevance  
- RAG pipeline in progress  

**Deliverables:**  
- Fine-tuned model + training scripts  

**What I Learned:**  
- Core tradeoffs between prompting vs fine-tuning  
- Importance of clean, differentiated training data

## 3) Spotify Listening Analytics Dashboard

**Summary:**  
Exploratory analysis of Spotify’s audio feature dataset to understand how musical properties changed across seasons, genres, and time.

**Approach:**  
- Cleaned & analyzed audio features in Python  
- Built dashboards visualizing seasonal/genre change  
- Developed static figures for trend clarity  

**Key Findings:**  
- Pop trending toward higher energy/danceability  
- Hip-Hop displays high tempo variability  
- R&B shows rising acoustic characteristics  

**Deliverables:**  
- Interactive dashboards  
- EDA notebook  

**What I Learned:**  
- Structuring EDA into digestible narratives  
- Communicating findings visually to non-technical audiences
